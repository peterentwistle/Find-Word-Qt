I am currently a student that enjoys science, gardening, traveling and making short animated films.
In my spare time I love to develop websites and web applications (I’m currently working on a new social network platform fruro.com). I also occasionally enjoy programming games.
I’m also an amateur photographer and like making YouTube videos. I love using social network sites and blogging sites such as Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr.
